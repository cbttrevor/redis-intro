## Learning Objectives

Redis can be run almost anywhere Linux can run.
I recommend using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to make it easy to spin up and upgrade Redis.
[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my preferred editor, as it offers easy navigation and a huge variety of extensions.
Make sure you have Python installed as well, as we'll be using that to program against the Redis Server.

You can use the [Scoop package manager](https://scoop.sh) on Windows to install and update software such as Visual Studio Code and Python.
Docker is also a great way to run Python, so you don't have to "install" it on your system.
Using containers allows you to run different versions of the same runtime simultaneously, without version conflicts.
