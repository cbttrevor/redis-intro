## Learning Objectives

You can use the `redis` module for Python to interact with a Redis cache service.
As with most modules, the `redis` module is [hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/redis/).
To install the `redis` module in Python, use `pip3 install redis`.

If you need to authenticate to Redis, you can use the password keyword parameter to the Redis class.
